## Project Setup & Running

### Starting the Development Server
To start the local development server for the frontend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command runs `vite` with host `0.0.0.0`.
Access the application at `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in the terminal).

### Package Manager
The project documentation mentions **Bun**, but `npm` is also used.
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`

### Environment
- The project uses **Vite** + **React**.
- **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling.
- **Zustand** is used for state management.
